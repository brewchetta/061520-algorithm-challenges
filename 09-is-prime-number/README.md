# Is Prime Number

Build a method / function that takes in an argument of an integer and returns whether or not that integer is a prime number.

```
isPrime(3) --> true
isPrime(6) --> false
```

Additionally, this returns false if the input isn't an integer, if the integer is negative, or if the integer is `0`:

```
isPrime("three") --> false
isPrime(-10) --> false
isPrime(0) --> false
```

When completing this challenge, think about how to best optimize it. This should ideally find an prime number up to the limits of the language you're using so be sure to test for really big prime numbers like 7919 or 27644437.
